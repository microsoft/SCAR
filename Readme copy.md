# STIG Compliance Automation Repository (SCAR)
___
## What is SCAR?
___
**SCAR** is a framework for managing and deploying standardized DSC Configurations at scale within your environment. DSCSM allows service and infrastructure owners to focus on the data important to them by leveraging dynamic DSC configuration scripts and separating configuration scripts from configuration data. Currently, DSCSM is focused on automating the generation/application of STIG configurations and the monitoring and reporting STIG compliance, including STIG checklist generation.

## Folder Structure
___
### NodeData

The NodeData folder stores Powershell Data files that represent the end nodes that you are targetting. Each NodeData .psd1 file should contain the following:

* NodeName - The Active Directory Computer Name of the end node. This is used by DSC to push the configuration MOF to that machine.
* LocalConfigurationManager Hashtable - Define the Local Configuration Manager settings for your end node(s).
* AppliedConfigurations Array - Define which configurations you want to apply to your end node(s).
* Parameter Hashtables - Use hashtables with Parameter values for each configuration you're applying.

### Configurations

Standardized configuration scripts should be located in the Configurations folder. Follow these guidlines for your configurations:

* Each configuration should be named the exact same as the file name.
* Use parameters for settings that allow for variance.

### MOFs

Once you run the Start-DscBuild function, the configurations for each defined node will be compiled and executed to generate MOFs for DSC settings and Meta.MOFs for LCM settings. Target this folder with Start-DSCConfiguration to push the compiled/generated configurations to every node.

### Artifacts

Once you run the Start-DscBuild funtion, the configurations for each defined node will be compiled into their own individual configuration scripts which will be exported into the artifacts folder for reference.

### Resources

The resources folder is used to store Powershell Modules, DSC Resource Modules, helper functions, etc that are relevent to your organization.

Build/Release functions for DSCSM are also stored in the resources folder.

### Tests

The Tests folder is where unit/integration tests are stored and executed from.

### Reports

DSC Compliance reports are stored in the Reports folder, along with other reporting features relevenet to your organization. For example, STIG checklists that are generated by the DSCSM functions will be stored here as well.

### Archive

All artifacts produced by DSCSM will be packaged, compressed, and stored in the Archive folder for future reference.
