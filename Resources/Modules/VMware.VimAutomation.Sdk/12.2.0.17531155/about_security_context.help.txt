SHORT DESCRIPTION
    The general workflow for using a security context is as follows: 1. Create a
    security context by directly authenticating the user who runs the
    New-*SecuritContext command. 2. Pass the security context to a
    Connect-*Server command that indirectly authenticates the user who runs the context.
    To create an OAuth2 security context for VMware Cloud Service, use the
    New-VcsOAuthSecurityContext
    command.
    To create a SAML2 security context for the vCenter Server service, use the
    New-VISamlSecurityContext
    command.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    When a user is directly authenticated, a security context object is created.
    ThÐµ security context object allows the user to be authenticated later when
    it is needed by another command.
    There are different ways to authenticate the user. For example, username and
    password, Windows-integrated authentication, multifactor authentication, and
    so on. How the security context will later indirectly authenticate the user
    depends on the authentication protocol supported by the authentication server.
    The general workflow for using a security context is as follows: 1. Create a
    security context by directly authenticating the user who runs the
    New-*SecuritContext command. 2. Pass the security context to a
    Connect-*Server command that indirectly authenticates the user who runs the context.
    Currently, VMware PowerCLI supports the following types of security context:
    - OAuth2 security context - for authentication servers that support
    authentication based on OAuth2 bearer tokens.
    - SAML2 security context - for authentication servers that support
    authentication based on SAML2 bearer tokens.
    The VMware Cloud Services family of products supports authentication with an
    OAuth2 security context.
    To create an OAuth2 security context for VMware Cloud Service, use the
    New-VcsOAuthSecurityContext
    command.
    The vCenter Server family of products supports mainly authentication with a
    SAML2 security context.
    To create a SAML2 security context for the vCenter Server service, use the
    New-VISamlSecurityContext
    command.
    If the vCenter Server supports OAuth2, you can create a SAML2 security
    context based on an OAuth2 security context from the trusted OAuth2
    authentication server. For more information, see
    New-VISamlSecurityContext
    .
    You can call the Dispose method on a security context object to invalidate a
    security context so that it cannot be used anymore.
