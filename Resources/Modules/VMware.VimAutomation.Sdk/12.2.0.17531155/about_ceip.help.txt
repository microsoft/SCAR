LONG DESCRIPTION
    VMware's Customer Experience Improvement Program ("CEIP") provides VMware
    with information that enables VMware to improve its products and services
    and to fix problems.  When you choose to participate in CEIP, VMware will
    collect technical information listed below about your use of the VMware
    products and services in CEIP reports on a regular basis.  This information
    does not personally identify you.

I. Configuration Data
    Data about how you have configured VMware products and services and related
    environment information. Examples of Configuration Data include version
    information for VMware products, product environment information, and
    product configuration settings.  Configuration Data may include obfuscated
    versions of your device IDs and MAC and Internet Protocol addresses.

II. Feature Usage Data
    Data about how you use VMware products and services.  Examples of Feature
    Usage Data include details about which product features you use and metrics

    VMware collects the above CEIP reporting information in connection with a
    unique CEIP instance identifier that is stored on your device and which does
    not personally identify you.  This identifier enables VMware to distinguish
    one report from another.
